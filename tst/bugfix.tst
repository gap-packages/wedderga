# Andreas Bachle and Inneke van Gelder reported a problem when there is 
# a simple component that is a division algebra with index 2 whose local
# index at infinity is 1, caused by "DefiningCharacterOfCyclotomicAlgebra" 
# looking for a field of values that was larger than it should be for these 
# groups. This was fixed by Allen Herman in Wedderga 4.6.2 (September 2014).
