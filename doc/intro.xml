The title ``&Wedderga;'' stands for ``<B>Wedder</B>burn decomposition of 
<B>g</B>roup <B>a</B>lgebras. This is a &GAP; package to compute the simple 
components of the Wedderburn decomposition of semisimple group algebras of finite 
groups over abelian number fields and over finite fields. 
It also contains functions that compute the primitive central idempotents 
of the same kind of group algebras.<P/>

<Section Label="IntroMain">
<Heading>Main functions of &Wedderga; package</Heading>

The main functions of &Wedderga; are 
<Ref Attr="WedderburnDecomposition" /> and
<Ref Attr="WedderburnDecompositionInfo" />.
<P/>

<Ref Attr="WedderburnDecomposition" /> 
computes a list of simple algebras such that their direct product is
isomorphic to the group algebra <M>FG</M>, given as input. 
Thus the direct product of the entries of the output is
the Wedderburn decomposition of <M>FG</M>. <P/>

If <M>F</M> is an abelian number field then 
the entries of the output are given as matrix algebras of cyclotomic algebras 
(see <Ref Sect="Cyclotomic" />), thus, the entries of the output of 
<Ref Attr="WedderburnDecomposition" /> 
are realizations of the Wedderburn components of <M>FG</M> as algebras which are Brauer equivalent 
to cyclotomic algebras. Recall that the Brauer-Witt Theorem ensures 
that every simple factor of a semisimple group ring <M>FG</M> is Brauer equivalent
(that is represents the same class in the Brauer group of its centre) 
to a cyclotomic algebra (<Cite Key="Y"/>, <Cite Key="Olteanu" />). 
<P/>

The Wedderburn components of <M>FG</M> are also matrix algebras over division rings 
which are finite extensions of the field <M>F</M>.
If <M>F</M> is finite then by the Wedderburn theorem these division rings 
are finite fields. In this case the output of 
<Ref Attr="WedderburnDecomposition" />
represents the factors of <M>FG</M> as matrix algebras over finite extensions
of the field <M>F</M>.
<P/>

<Example>
<![CDATA[

<algebra-with-one over Rationals, with 2 generators>
gap> WedderburnDecomposition( QG );
[ Rationals, Rationals, ( Rationals^[ 3, 3 ] ), ( Rationals^[ 3, 3 ] ), 
  <crossed product over CF(3), with 2 generators and center=Rationals> ]

<algebra-with-one over CF(5), with 2 generators>
gap> WedderburnDecomposition( FG );

  <crossed product over AsField( CF(5), CF(15) ), with
    2 generators and center=CF(5)> ]

  ( GF(5^2)^[ 2, 2 ] ), ( GF(5)^[ 3, 3 ] ) ]
]]>
</Example>

Instead of <Ref Attr="WedderburnDecompositionInfo" />, that returns a list of 
&GAP; objects, <Ref Attr="WedderburnDecompositionInfo" /> returns the numerical 
description of these objects. 
See Section <Ref Sect="NumDesc" /> for theoretical background.

<Section Label="IntroInstall">
<Heading>Installation and system requirements</Heading>

&Wedderga; does not use external binaries and, therefore, works without
restrictions on the type of the operation system. It is designed for &GAP;4.4  
and no compatibility with previous releases of &GAP;4 is guaranteed. 
<P/>

To use the &Wedderga; online help it is necessary to install the &GAP;4 package 
&GAPDoc; by Frank L\"ubeck and Max Neunh\"offer, which is available from the 
&GAP; site or from 
<URL>http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/GAPDoc/</URL>.
<P/> 

&Wedderga; is distributed in standard formats
(<File>zoo</File>, <File>tar.gz</File>, <File>tar.bz2</File>, 
<File>-win.zip</File>) and can be obtained from 
<URL>http://ukrgap.exponenta.ru/wedderga.htm</URL>.
To unpack the archive <File>wedderga-4.0.zoo</File> you need the program 
<File>unzoo</File>, which can be obtained from the &GAP; homepage 
<URL>http://www.gap-system.org/</URL> (see section `Distribution').
To install &Wedderga;, copy this archive into the <File>pkg</File> subdirectory of your 
&GAP;4.4 installation. The subdirectory <File>wedderga</File> will be created in 
the <File>pkg</File> directory after the following command:
<P/>
  <C>unzoo -x wedderga-4.0.zoo</C>
<P/>
