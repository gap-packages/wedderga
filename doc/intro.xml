The title ``&Wedderga;'' stands for ``<B>Wedder</B>burn decomposition of 
<B>g</B>roup <B>a</B>lgebras. This is a &GAP; package to compute the simple 
components of the Wedderburn decomposition of group algebras of finite 
groups over the field of rationals and over finite fields. It also contains
functions that produce the primitive central idempotents of these group 
algebras.

<Section Label="IntroSecond">
<Heading>Main functions of &Wedderga; package</Heading>

The main functions of &Wedderga; are 
<Ref Attr="WedderburnDecomposition" /> and
<Ref Attr="WedderburnDecompositionInfo" />.
<P/>

<Ref Attr="WedderburnDecomposition" /> 
computes a list of simple algebras whose direct product is isomorphic to
the group ring <M>KG</M> given as an input, where <M>G</M> should be a finite
group, and <M>K</M> is either a field <M>Q</M> of rationals or a finite field of
characterisitc coprime with the order of <M>G</M>. If <M>K=Q</M> then these 
simple algebras are given as matrix algebras over some crossed product over 
some ciclotomic extension of the field <M>Q</M>. If <M>K</M> is finite then 
they are given as matrix algebras over finite extensions of <M>K</M>.
<P/>

<Example>
<![CDATA[
gap> QG:=GroupRing(Rationals,SymmetricGroup(4));;
<algebra-with-one over Rationals, with 2 generators>
gap> WedderburnDecomposition(QG);
[ Rationals, Rationals, ( Rationals^[ 3, 3 ] ), ( Rationals^[ 3, 3 ] ),
  <crossed product over CF(3), with 2 generators> ]
gap> FG:=GroupRing(GF(5),SymmetricGroup(4));
<algebra-with-one over GF(5), with 2 generators>
gap> WedderburnDecomposition(FG);
[ GF(5), GF(5), ( GF(5)^[ 3, 3 ] ), ( GF(5)^[ 3, 3 ] ), ( GF(5)^[ 2, 2 ] ) ]
]]>
</Example>

Instead of WedderburnDecomposition, that returns a list of GAP objects, 
WedderburnDecompositionInfo returnes the description of these objects.
See next chapter for theoretical background and examples of its usage.

Warnings:
- when WedderburnDecompositionInfo usage is cheaper then WedderburnDecomposition
- when you want to find out which namely crossed product do you have?

<Heading>Wedderburn decomposition of group algebras</Heading>

When you know idempotents, the question is to obtain a useful description of
simple components, corresponding to them

<Heading>Installation and system requirements</Heading>

&Wedderga; does not use external binaries and, therefore, works without
restrictions on the type of the operation system. It is designed for &GAP;4.4  
and no compatibility with previous releases of &GAP;4 is guaranteed. 
<P/>

To use the &Wedderga; online help it is necessary to install the &GAP;4 package 
&GAPDoc; by Frank L\"ubeck and Max Neunh\"offer, which is available from the 
&GAP; site or from 
<URL>http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/GAPDoc/</URL>.
<P/> 

&Wedderga; is distributed in standard formats
(<File>zoo</File>, <File>tar.gz</File>, <File>tar.bz2</File>, 
<File>-win.zip</File>) and can be obtained from 
<URL>http://ukrgap.exponenta.ru/wedderga.htm</URL>.
To unpack the archive <File>wedderga-4.0.zoo</File> you need the program 
<File>unzoo</File>, which can be obtained from the &GAP; homepage 
<URL>http://www.gap-system.org/</URL> (see section `Distribution').
To install &Wedderga;, copy this archive into the <File>pkg</File> subdirectory of your 
&GAP;4.4 installation. The subdirectory <File>wedderga</File> will be created in 
the <File>pkg</File> directory after the following command:
<P/>
  <C>unzoo -x wedderga-4.0.zoo</C>
