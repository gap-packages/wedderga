The title ``&Wedderga;'' stands for ``<B>Wedder</B>burn decomposition of 
<B>g</B>roup <B>a</B>lgebras. This is a &GAP; package to compute the simple 
components of the Wedderburn decomposition of group algebras of finite 
groups over the field of rationals and over finite fields. It also contains
functions that produce the primitive central idempotents of these group 
algebras.

<Section Label="IntroMain">
<Heading>Main functions of &Wedderga; package</Heading>

The main functions of &Wedderga; are 
<Ref Attr="WedderburnDecomposition" /> and
<Ref Attr="WedderburnDecompositionInfo" />.
<P/>

<Ref Attr="WedderburnDecomposition" /> 
computes a list of simple algebras whose direct product is isomorphic to the group ring <M>FG</M> 
given as an input if some conditions are satisfied (see Chapter <Ref Chap="Theory" />), 
where <M>G</M> should be a finite group, and <M>F</M> is either a field <M>Q</M> of rationals or a 
finite field of characterisitc coprime with the order of <M>G</M>. <P/>

If <M>F=Q</M> then the simple algebras are given as matrix algebras over some crossed products over 
some cyclotomic extensions of the field <M>Q</M>. 
These crossed products are in fact cyclotomic algebras <Ref Sect="Cyclotomic" /> and thus the entries of the 
output of <Ref Attr="WedderburnDecomposition" /> are realizations of the Wedderburn components 
of <M>QG</M> as algebras similar to cyclotomic algebras, as the Brauer-Witt Theorem ensures <Cite Key="BR" />. <P/>

If <M>F</M> is finite then the factors are given as matrix algebras over finite extensions of <M>F</M>.
<P/>

<Example>
<![CDATA[
gap> QG:=GroupRing(Rationals,SymmetricGroup(4));;
<algebra-with-one over Rationals, with 2 generators>
gap> WedderburnDecomposition(QG);
[ Rationals, Rationals, ( Rationals^[ 3, 3 ] ), ( Rationals^[ 3, 3 ] ),
  <crossed product over CF(3), with 2 generators> ]
gap> FG:=GroupRing(GF(5),SymmetricGroup(4));
<algebra-with-one over GF(5), with 2 generators>
gap> WedderburnDecomposition(FG);
[ GF(5), GF(5), ( GF(5)^[ 3, 3 ] ), ( GF(5)^[ 3, 3 ] ), ( GF(5)^[ 2, 2 ] ) ]
]]>
</Example>

Instead of <Ref Attr="WedderburnDecompositionInfo" />, that returns a list of GAP objects, 
<Ref Attr="WedderburnDecompositionInfo" /> returnes the description of these objects.
See Chapter <Ref Chap="Theory" /> for theoretical background.

<Section Label="IntroInstall">
<Heading>Installation and system requirements</Heading>

&Wedderga; does not use external binaries and, therefore, works without
restrictions on the type of the operation system. It is designed for &GAP;4.4  
and no compatibility with previous releases of &GAP;4 is guaranteed. 
<P/>

To use the &Wedderga; online help it is necessary to install the &GAP;4 package 
&GAPDoc; by Frank L\"ubeck and Max Neunh\"offer, which is available from the 
&GAP; site or from 
<URL>http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/GAPDoc/</URL>.
<P/> 

&Wedderga; is distributed in standard formats
(<File>zoo</File>, <File>tar.gz</File>, <File>tar.bz2</File>, 
<File>-win.zip</File>) and can be obtained from 
<URL>http://ukrgap.exponenta.ru/wedderga.htm</URL>.
To unpack the archive <File>wedderga-4.0.zoo</File> you need the program 
<File>unzoo</File>, which can be obtained from the &GAP; homepage 
<URL>http://www.gap-system.org/</URL> (see section `Distribution').
To install &Wedderga;, copy this archive into the <File>pkg</File> subdirectory of your 
&GAP;4.4 installation. The subdirectory <File>wedderga</File> will be created in 
the <File>pkg</File> directory after the following command:
<P/>
  <C>unzoo -x wedderga-4.0.zoo</C>
<P/>
