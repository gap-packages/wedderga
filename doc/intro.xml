The title ``&Wedderga;'' stands for ``<B>Wedder</B>burn decomposition of a 
<B>g</B>roup <B>a</B>lgebras. This is a &GAP; package to compute the simple 
components of the Wedderburn decomposition of group algebras of finite 
groups over fields of characteristic zero and over finite fields. 
It also contains functions that produce the primitive central idempotents 
of these group algebras.<P/>

<Section Label="IntroMain">
<Heading>Main functions of &Wedderga; package</Heading>

The main functions of &Wedderga; are 
<Ref Attr="WedderburnDecomposition" /> and
<Ref Attr="WedderburnDecompositionInfo" />.
<P/>

<Ref Attr="WedderburnDecomposition" /> 
computes a list of simple algebras such that its direct product is a direct
factor of the group algebra <M>FG</M> given as input, where <M>G</M> should be a 
finite group, and <M>F</M> has to be either the field <M>Q</M> of rationals or a 
finite field of characterisitc coprime with the order of <M>G</M>. <P/>

If the group <M>G</M> satisfies some mild conditions the the direct product of 
the output is the full group ring <M>FG</M> so that, in that case, the output 
is the Wedderburn decomposition of <M>FG</M>. 
For example this is the case if <M>G</M> is abelian by supersolvable.
(see Chapter <Ref Chap="Theory" />) for theoretical background.  

The entries of the output are given as matrix algebras over some 
crossed products over some cyclotomic extensions of the field <M>F</M>. 
These crossed products are in fact cyclotomic algebras <Ref Sect="Cyclotomic" /> 
and thus the entries of the output of <Ref Attr="WedderburnDecomposition" /> 
are realizations of the Wedderburn components of <M>QG</M> as algebras similar 
to cyclotomic algebras. Recall that the Brauer-Witt Theorem ensures 
that every simple factor of a semisimple group ring <M>FG</M> is similar 
(that is represents the same class in the Brauer group of its centre) 
to a cyclotomic algebra <Cite Key="BR" />. <P/>

The simple factors of <M>FG</M> are also matrix algebras over division rings 
which are finite extensions of the coefficient ring <M>F</M>.
If <M>F</M> is finite then these division rings are finite fields, by Wedderburn 
Theorem. In that case the the output of <Ref Attr="WedderburnDecomposition" />
represents the factors of <M>FG</M> as matrix algebras over finite extensions of 
<M>F</M>.
<P/>

<Example>
<![CDATA[
gap> QG:=GroupRing(Rationals,SymmetricGroup(4));;
<algebra-with-one over Rationals, with 2 generators>
gap> WedderburnDecomposition(QG);
[ Rationals, Rationals, ( Rationals^[ 3, 3 ] ), ( Rationals^[ 3, 3 ] ),
  <crossed product over CF(3), with 2 generators> ]
gap> FG:=GroupRing(GF(5),SymmetricGroup(4));
<algebra-with-one over GF(5), with 2 generators>
gap> WedderburnDecomposition(FG);
[ GF(5), GF(5), ( GF(5)^[ 3, 3 ] ), ( GF(5)^[ 3, 3 ] ), ( GF(5)^[ 2, 2 ] ) ]
]]>
</Example>

Instead of <Ref Attr="WedderburnDecompositionInfo" />, that returns a list of 
GAP objects, <Ref Attr="WedderburnDecompositionInfo" /> returns the numerical 
description of these objects. 
See Chapter <Ref Sect="SSPDef" /> for theoretical background.

<Heading>Installation and system requirements</Heading>

&Wedderga; does not use external binaries and, therefore, works without
restrictions on the type of the operation system. It is designed for &GAP;4.4  
and no compatibility with previous releases of &GAP;4 is guaranteed. 
<P/>

To use the &Wedderga; online help it is necessary to install the &GAP;4 package 
&GAPDoc; by Frank L\"ubeck and Max Neunh\"offer, which is available from the 
&GAP; site or from 
<URL>http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/GAPDoc/</URL>.
<P/> 

&Wedderga; is distributed in standard formats
(<File>zoo</File>, <File>tar.gz</File>, <File>tar.bz2</File>, 
<File>-win.zip</File>) and can be obtained from 
<URL>http://ukrgap.exponenta.ru/wedderga.htm</URL>.
To unpack the archive <File>wedderga-4.0.zoo</File> you need the program 
<File>unzoo</File>, which can be obtained from the &GAP; homepage 
<URL>http://www.gap-system.org/</URL> (see section `Distribution').
To install &Wedderga;, copy this archive into the <File>pkg</File> subdirectory of your 
&GAP;4.4 installation. The subdirectory <File>wedderga</File> will be created in 
the <File>pkg</File> directory after the following command:
<P/>
  <C>unzoo -x wedderga-4.0.zoo</C>
<P/>
