  [33X[0;0YWe  say  that  a  ring  [22XR[122X is semisimple if it is a direct sum of simple left
  (alternatively  right) ideals or equivalently if [22XR[122X is isomorphic to a direct

  [33X[0;0YBy  Maschke's  Theorem,  if [22XG[122X is a finite group then the group algebra [22XFG[122X is

  [33X[0;0YIf  [22XR[122X  is  a [13Xsemisimple ring[113X ([14X9.2[114X) then the [13XWedderburn decomposition[113X of [22XR[122X is
  the  decomposition  of [22XR[122X as a direct product of simple algebras. The factors
  of this Wedderburn decomposition are called [13XWedderburn components[113X of [22XR[122X. Each

  idempotent[113X ([14X9.4[114X) of [22XR[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YLet   [22XFG[122X   be   a   [13Xsemisimple  group  algebra[113X  ([14X9.2[114X).  If  [22XF[122X  has  positive
  characteristic,  then  the  Wedderburn  components of [22XFG[122X are matrix algebras
  over  finite  extensions  of  [22XF[122X.  If  [22XF[122X  has zero characteristic then by the
  [13XBrauer-Witt  Theorem[113X  [Yam74],  the  [13XWedderburn  components[113X of [22XFG[122X are [13XBrauer

  [33X[0;0YThe  main  functions  of  [5XWedderga[105X  compute  the  Wedderburn components of a
  semisimple  group  algebra  [22XFG[122X, such that the coefficient field is either an
  abelian  number  field  (i.e. a subfield of a finite cyclotomic extension of
  the  rationals)  or  a  finite  field.  In  the  finite case, the Wedderburn
  components are matrix algebras over finite fields and so can be described by
  the size of the matrices and the size of the finite field.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  the  zero  characteristic  case  each  Wedderburn  component [22XA[122X is [13XBrauer

  (possibly  fractional)  matrix  algebra  over  [13Xcyclotomic algebra[113X and can be
  described numerically in one of the following three forms:[133X

  [124X
  
  [33X[0;0Ywhere  [22Xn[122X  is the matrix size, [22XK[122X is the centre of [22XA[122X (a finite field extension
  of  [22XF[122X) and the remaining data are integers whose interpretation is explained
  in [14X9.12[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  some cases (for the zero characteristic coefficient field) the size [22Xn[122X of
  the  matrix  algebras  is  not  a  positive  integer but a positive rational
  number.  This  is  a  consequence  of  the fact that the [13XBrauer-Witt Theorem[113X
  [Yam74]  only  ensures  that each [13XWedderburn component[113X ([14X9.3[114X) of a semisimple
  group algebra is Brauer equivalent ([14X9.5[114X) to a [13Xcyclotomic algebra[113X ([14X9.11[114X), but
  not necessarily isomorphic to a full matrix algebra of a cyclotomic algebra.
  For  example,  a Wedderburn component [22XD[122X of a group algebra can be a division
  algebra  but  not  a cyclotomic algebra. In this case [22XM_n(D)[122X is a cyclotomic
  algebra  [22XC[122X for some [22Xn[122X and therefore [22XD[122X can be described as [22XM_1/n(C)[122X (see last
  Example in [2XWedderburnDecomposition[102X ([14X2.1-1[114X)).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe main algorithm of [5XWedderga[105X is based on a computational oriented proof of
  the  Brauer-Witt  Theorem due to Olteanu [Olt07] which uses previous work by

  algebras  of  [13Xstrongly monomial groups[113X ([14X9.17[114X). The algorithms are also based
  upon  the  work  of  Bakshi  and  Maheshwary [BM14] (see also [BM16]) on the

  [22XP[122X of [22XF[122X is a lowest terms fraction [22Xr/m_P[122X whose denominator is the local Schur

  [33X[0;0YThe local Schur index functions in wedderga produce a list of the nontrivial

  rational  primes.  The Schur index of the simple algebra over [22XF[122X is the least
  common  multiple [22Xm[122X of these local indices, and the dimension of the division
  algebra  part  of  the simple algebra over [22XF[122X is [22Xm^2[122X. While not sufficient to
  identify  these  division  algebras  up to ring isomorphism in general, this
  list  of  local  indices  does  identify  the  division  algebra  up to ring
  isomorphism  whenever  there  is no pair of local indices at odd primes that
  are greater than 2. (This is at least the case for groups of order less than
  3^2*7*13.) So it gives the information desired in most basic situations, and
  allows  one  to  distinguish  almost all pairs of simple components of group
  algebras.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWedderga's  functions  compute  local  indices  for  generalized  quaternion
  algebras defined over the rationals and cyclotomic algebras defined over any
  abelian  number  field.  Special shortcut functions are available for cyclic
  cyclotomic  algebras.  There are also versions of the functions that compute
  the  local  and  global  Schur index of a character of a finite group over a
  given  abelian  number  field. The steps in the general character- theoretic
  method  involve  1) a Brauer-Witt reduction to a cyclic-by-abelian group, 2)
  use of the Frobenius-Schur indicator to compute the local index at infinity,
  3)  computing the [22Xp[122X-local index for an ordinary irreducible character [22Xχ[122X of a
  [22Xp[122X-solvable  group using the values of an irreducible Brauer character in the
  same [22Xp[122X-block in cases where the [22Xp[122X-defect group of [22Xχ[122X is cyclic, and 4) use of
  Riese  and  Schmid's  characterization  of  dyadic Schur groups ([Sch94] and
  [RS96])  to handle the exceptional cases where step 3) is not available. Our
  approach  to  rational  quaternion  algebras  is the standard one given, for
  example,  in  [Pie82].  The  Legendre  symbol  operation  in  GAP is used to
  determine  the local index at odd primes. The local index of the generalized
  quaternion  algebra  [22X(a,b)[122X  over [22XQ[122X at the infinite prime will be [22X2[122X if both [22Xa[122X
  and  [22Xb[122X  are  negative,  and  otherwise  [22X1[122X.  We avoid the complicated case of
  quadratic    reciprocity    when    working    over    Q    by   using   the
  Hasse-Brauer-Albert-Noether  Theorem  ([Rei03],  pg. 276): since we know the
  other  primes of [22XQ[122X where the local index is [22X2[122X, it determines the local index
  at  the  prime  [22X2[122X.  For generalized quaternion algebras over number fields [22XF[122X
  other than [22XQ[122X, we have to convert to cyclic or cyclic cyclotomic algebras and
  use  the  other  local  index functions, or appeal to a number theory system
  outside of GAP that can solve norm equations.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere  are  three shortcut functions used to compute local indices of cyclic
  cyclotomic  algebras,  which  wedderga's -Info functions produce in the form
  [22X[r,F,n,[a,b,c]][122X. The local index at infinity is calculated by determining if
  the  real  completion  of  the  corresponding  algebra  will  produce a real
  quaternion  algebra.  In order to do this, [22XF[122X must be a real subfield, [22Xn[122X must
  be  strictly  greater than [22X2[122X, and [22XE(n)^c[122X (which has to be a root of unity in
  [22XF[122X)  must  be [22X-1[122X. These facts can be checked directly, so this is faster than
  calculating  the  character  table  of the group and checking the value of a
  Frobenius-Schur  indicator.  The  shortcut to calculate the local index of a
  cyclic  cyclotomic algebra at an odd prime makes direct use of the following
  lemma  of  Janusz:  If  [22XE_p/F_p[122X is a Galois extension of [22Xp[122X-local fields with
  ramification index [22Xe[122X, and [22Xz[122X is a root of unity with order prime to [22Xp[122X, then [22Xz[122X
  is  a norm in [22XE_p/F_p[122X if and only if it is the [22Xe[122X-th power of a root of unity
  in  [22XF[122X.  ([Jan75],  pg. 535). It follows that in order to calculate the local
  index  at  [22Xp[122X  of  a  cyclic  cyclotomic  algebra  [22X[r,F,n,[a,b,c]][122X,  we first
  determine  the splitting degree, residue degree, and ramification index [22Xe[122X of
  the  extension  [22XF(ζ_n)/F[122X  at  [22Xp[122X.  Comparing  the  behaviour  of  the  Galois
  automorphism  [22Xσ_b[122X to the behaviour of the Frobenius automorphism at [22Xp[122X allows
  us  to determine the order of the largest root of unity [22Xz[122X with order coprime

  [33X[0;0YThe  wedderga  function  that  computes  the  [22Xp[122X-local  index  of an ordinary
  irreducible character [22Xχ[122X of a finite non-nilpotent cyclic-by- abelian group [22XG[122X
  is  based  directly on a theorem of Benard [Ben76] that applies whenever the
  [22Xp[122X-defect  group of [22Xχ[122X is cyclic. We have to restrict our application of it to
  groups whose orders are small because the [5XGAP[105X records for irreducible Brauer
  characters  are only available in these cases. In order to use this approach
  effectively,  we  developed a function that computes the defect group of the
  block  containing  a  given  ordinary irreducible character [22Xχ[122X. This function
  makes  use  of  the Min half of Brauer's Min-Max theorem (see Theorem 4.4 of
  [Nav98]),  and  thus  is  able  to  find  the defect group directly from the
  ordinary  character table. It is thus available for nonsolvable groups, even
  in  cases  where  [5XGAP[105X's  Brauer  character records are not available. We are
  indebted to Michael Geline and Friederich Ladisch for discussions concerning
  the  calculation  of  defect  groups in [5XGAP[105X. The current algorithm we use is

  minimal  left ideals. In particular, let [22XR=⊕_i=1^t L_i[122X be a decomposition of
