<Heading>The basic theory behind &Wedderga;</Heading>    


In this chapter we describe the theory that is behind the algorithms used by &Wedderga;. <P/>

All the rings considered in this chapter are associative and have an identity. <P/>

We use the following notation: <M>&QQ;</M> denotes the field of rationals and <M>\mathbb F_q</M> the finite field 
of order <M>q</M>. For every positive integer <M>k</M>, we denote a complex <M>k</M>-th primitive root 
of unity by <M>\xi_k</M> and so <M>&QQ;(\xi_k)</M> is the <M>k</M>-th cyclotomic extension of <M>&QQ;</M>.

<Index>group ring</Index>
Given a group <M>G</M> and a ring <M>R</M>, the <E>group ring</E> 
<M>RG</M> over the group <M>G</M> with coefficients in <M>R</M> is the ring whose underlying additive 
group is a right <M>R-</M>module with basis <M>G</M> such that the product is defined by the 
following rule
  <Display> 
  (gr)(hs)=(gh)(rs)
  </Display>
for <M>r,s \in R</M> and <M>g, h \in G</M>, and extended to <M>RG</M> by linearity.
<P/>

<Index>group algebra</Index>
A <E>group algebra</E> is a group ring in which the coefficient ring is a field.

<Index>semisimple ring</Index>

We say that a ring <M>R</M> is semisimple if it is a direct sum of simple 
left (alternatively right) ideals or equivalently if <M>R</M> is isomorphic 
to a direct product of simple algebras each one isomorphic to a matrix ring 
over a division ring.
<P/>
 
By Maschke's Theorem, if <M>G</M> is a finite group then the group algebra 
<M>FG</M> is semisimple if and only the characteristic of the coefficient 
field <M>F</M> does not divide the order of <M>G</M>.
<P/>

In fact, an arbitrary group ring <M>RG</M> is semisimple if and only if the 
coefficient ring <M>R</M> is semisimple, the group <M>G</M> is finite and 
the order of <M>G</M> is invertible in <M>R</M>.
<P/>

Some authors use the notion semisimple ring for rings with zero Jacobson 
radical. To avoid confusion we usually refer to semisimple rings as 
semisimple artinian rings.

<Index>Wedderburn decomposition</Index>
<Index>Wedderburn components</Index>

If <M>R</M> is a <E>semisimple ring</E> (<Ref Sect="Semisimple" />) then the <E>Wedderburn decomposition</E> of 
<M>R</M> is the decomposition of <M>R</M> as a direct product of simple algebras. 
The factors of this Wedderburn decomposition are called <E>Wedderburn components</E>
of <M>R</M>. 
Each Wedderburn component of <M>R</M> is of the form <M>Re</M> for <M>e</M> a <E>primitive central 
idempotent</E> (<Ref Sect="Idempotents" />) of <M>R</M>.
<P/> 

Let <M>FG</M> be a <E>semisimple group algebra</E> (<Ref Sect="Semisimple" />).
If <M>F</M> has positive characteristic, then the Wedderburn components of <M>FG</M>
are matrix algebras over finite extensions of <M>F</M>.
If <M>F</M> has zero characteristic then by the 
<E>Brauer-Witt Theorem</E> <Cite Key="Y" />, 
the <E>Wedderburn components</E> of <M>FG</M> are <E>Brauer equivalent</E> 
(<Ref Sect="Brauer" />)
to <E>cyclotomic algebras</E> (<Ref Sect="Cyclotomic" />). <P/> 

The main functions of &Wedderga; compute the Wedderburn components of a semisimple group algebra <M>FG</M>,
such that the coefficient field is either an abelian number field (i.e. a subfield of a finite cyclotomic extension 
of the rationals) or a finite field. 
In the finite case, the Wedderburn components are matrix algebras over finite fields and so can be described by the 
size of the matrices and the size of the finite field.
<P/>

In the zero characteristic case each Wedderburn component <M>A</M> is <E>Brauer equivalent</E> (<Ref Sect="Brauer"/>)
to a <E>cyclotomic algebra</E> (<Ref Sect="Cyclotomic" />) 
and therefore <M>A</M> is a 
(possibly fractional) matrix algebra over <E>cyclotomic algebra</E> 
and can be described numerically in one of the following three forms:
  <Display>
  [n,K],
  </Display> 

  <Display>
  [n,K,k,[d,\alpha,\beta]],
  </Display>
  
  <Display>
  [n,K,k,[d_i,\alpha_i,\beta_i]_{i=1}^m, [\gamma_{i,j}]_{1\le i &lt; j \le n} ],
  </Display>
where <M>n</M> is the matrix size, <M>K</M> is the centre of <M>A</M> (a finite field extension of <M>F</M>) 
and the remaining data are integers whose interpretation is explained in <Ref Sect="NumDesc" />.
<P/>

In some cases (for the zero characteristic coefficient field) the size <M>n</M> 
of the matrix algebras is not a positive integer but a positive rational number. 
This is a consequence of the fact that the <E>Brauer-Witt Theorem</E> 
<Cite Key="Y" /> only ensures that each <E>Wedderburn component</E> 
(<Ref Sect="WedDec" />) of a semisimple group algebra is Brauer equivalent 
(<Ref Sect="Brauer" />) to a <E>cyclotomic algebra</E> (<Ref Sect="Cyclotomic" />), 
but not necessarily isomorphic to a full matrix algebra of a cyclotomic algebra. 
For example, a Wedderburn component <M>D</M> of a group algebra can be a division 
algebra but not a cyclotomic algebra. In this case <M>M_n(D)</M> is a cyclotomic 
algebra <M>C</M> for some <M>n</M> and therefore <M>D</M> can be described
as <M>M_{1/n}(C)</M> (see last Example in <Ref Attr="WedderburnDecomposition" />).
<P/> 

The main algorithm of &Wedderga; is based on a computational oriented proof of the Brauer-Witt Theorem
due to Olteanu <Cite Key="O" /> which uses previous work by Olivieri, del Río and Simón <Cite Key="ORS" /> 
for rational group algebras of <E>strongly monomial groups</E> 
(<Ref Sect="StMon" />).

A <E>crossed product</E> <Cite Key="P" /> of <M>G</M> over <M>R</M> (or with coefficients in <M>R</M>) is a ring <M>R*G</M> with 
a decomposition into a direct sum of additive subgroups

* <M>A_g A_h = A_{gh}</M> and <P/>

<B>Extrinsic definition</B>.

Let <M>Aut(R)</M> denote the group of automorphisms of <M>R</M> and let <M>R^*</M> denote the group of units of 
<M>R</M>.<P/>

Let <M>a:G \rightarrow Aut(R)</M> and <M>t:G \times G \rightarrow R^*</M> 
be mappings satisfying the following conditions 
for every <M>g</M>, <M>h</M> and <M>k</M> in <M>G</M>: 
<P/>

(1) <M>a(gh)^{-1} a(g) a(h)</M> is the inner automorphism of <M>R</M> induced by 
<M>t(g,h)</M> (i.e. the automorphism <M>x\mapsto t(g,h)^{-1} x t(g,h)</M>) and <P/>

(2) <M>t(gh,k) t(g,h)^k = t(g,hk) t(h,k)</M>, where for 
<M>g \in G</M> and <M>x \in R</M> we denote <M>a(g)(x)</M> by <M>x^g</M>.
<P/>

The <E>crossed product</E> <Cite Key="P" /> of <M>G</M> over <M>R</M> (or with coefficients in <M>R</M>), 
action <M>a</M> and twisting <M>t</M> is the ring

The associativity of the product defined is a consequence of conditions (1) and (2) <Cite Key="P" />.<P/>

<B>Equivalence of the two definitions</B>.

Obviously the crossed product of <M>G</M> over <M>R</M> defined using the extrinsic definition is a crossed product 
of <M>G</M> over <M>u_1 R</M> in the sense of the first definition. 
Moreover, there is <M>r_0</M> in <M>R^*</M> such that <M>u_1r_0</M> is the identity of <M>R*_a^t G</M> and the map 
<M>r \mapsto u_1 r_0 r </M> is a ring isomorphism <M>R \rightarrow u_1R </M>. <P/>

<Index Key="Basis of units">Basis of units (for crossed product)</Index>
Conversely, let <M>R*G=\bigoplus_{g\in G} A_g</M> be an (intrinsic) crossed product and select for each <M>g\in G</M> a 
unit <M>u_g\in A_g</M> of <M>R*G</M>. 
This is called a <E>basis of units for the crossed product</E> <M>R*G</M>. 
Then the maps <M>a:G \rightarrow Aut(R)</M> and <M>t:G\times G \rightarrow R^*</M> given by 
  <Display>
  r^g = u_g^{-1} r u_g, \quad t(g,h) = u_{gh}^{-1} u_g u_h \quad (g,h \in G, r \in R)
  </Display>
satisfy conditions (1) and (2) and <M>R*G = R*_a^t G</M>. <P/>

The choice of a basis of units <M>u_g \in A_g</M> determines the action <M>a</M> and twisting <M>t</M>. 
If <M>\{u_g \in A_g : g \in G \}</M> and <M>\{v_g \in A_g : g \in G \}</M> are two sets of units of <M>R*G</M>
then <M>v_g = u_g r_g</M> for some units <M>r_g</M> of <M>R</M>. 
Changing the basis of units results in a change of the action and the twisting and so changes the extrinsic definition of
the crossed product but it does not change the intrinsic crossed product. <P/> 

It is customary to select <M>u_1=1</M>. In that case <M>a(1)</M> is the identity map of <M>R</M> and 
<M>t(1,g)=t(g,1)=1</M> for each <M>g</M> in <M>G</M>.

<Heading>Strong Shoda pairs of a group</Heading>

<Index>strong Shoda pair</Index>
A <E>strong Shoda pair</E> of <M>G</M> is a pair <M>(K,H)</M> of
subgroups of <M>G</M> satisfying the following conditions:<P/>
* <M>H</M> is normal in <M>K</M> and <M>K</M> is normal in the normalizer <M>N</M> of <M>H</M> in 
  <M>G</M>, <P/>
* <M>K/H</M> is cyclic and a maximal abelian subgroup of <M>N/H</M> and <P/>

(See <Ref Sect="IdempotentsSbgps" /> for the definition of <M>\varepsilon(K,H)</M>).
<P/>

Let <M>(K,H)</M> be a strong Shoda pair of <M>G</M>. 
Then <M>(K,H)</M> is a Shoda pair (<Ref Sect="SPDef" />) of <M>G</M>. 
Thus there is a linear character <M>\theta</M> of <M>K</M> with kernel <M>H</M> 
such that the induced character <M>\chi=\chi(G,K,H)=\theta^G</M> is irreducible. 
Moreover the <E>primitive central idempotent</E> (<Ref Sect="Idempotents" />)
<M>e_{&QQ; }(\chi)</M> of <M>&QQ; G</M> 
realized by <M>(K,H)</M> is <M>e(G,K,H)</M>, see <Cite Key="ORS" />. <P/>

<Index>equivalent strong Shoda pairs</Index>
Two <E>strong Shoda pairs</E> (<Ref Sect="SSPDef"/>) <M>(K_1,H_1)</M> and <M>(K_2,H_2)</M> of <M>G</M> 
are said to be <E>equivalent</E> if the characters
<M>\chi(G,K_1,H_1)</M> and <M>\chi(G,K_2,H_2)</M> are Galois conjugate, or equivalently if 
<M>e(G,K_1,H_1)=e(G,K_2,H_2)</M>.<P/>

The advantage of strong Shoda pairs over Shoda pairs is that 
one can describe the simple algebra
<M>FGe_F(\chi)</M> as a matrix algebra of a <E>cyclotomic algebra</E> 
(<Ref Sect="Cyclotomic" />, see <Cite Key="ORS" /> for <M>F=&QQ; </M> and 
<Cite Key="O" /> for the general case). <P/>

More precisely, <M>&QQ; Ge(G,K,H)</M> is isomorphic to <M>M_n(&QQ; (\xi)*_a^t N/K)</M>, 
where <M>\xi</M> is a <M>[K:H]</M>-th root of unity, <M>N</M> is the normalizer of 
<M>H</M> in <M>G</M>, <M>n=[G:N]</M> and <M>&QQ; (\xi)*_a^t N/K</M> is a <E>crossed product</E> (see <Ref Sect="CrossedProd" />) with action <M>a</M> and twisting <M>t</M> given as follows: <P/>
Let <M>x</M> be a fixed generator of <M>K/H</M> and 
<M>\varphi : N/K \rightarrow N/H</M> a fixed left inverse of the canonical projection 
<M>N/H\rightarrow N/K</M>. Then 
  <Display>
  \xi^{a(r)} = \xi^i, \mbox{ if }  x^{\varphi(r)}= x^i
  </Display>
and 
  <Display>
  t(r,s) = \xi^j, \mbox{ if } \varphi(rs)^{-1} \varphi(r)\varphi(s) = x^j,
  </Display>
for <M>r,s \in N/K</M> and integers <M>i</M> and <M>j</M>, see <Cite Key="ORS" />. 
Notice that the cocycle is the one given by the natural extension
  <Display>
  1 \rightarrow K/H \rightarrow N/H \rightarrow N/K \rightarrow 1 
  </Display>
where <M>K/H</M> is identified with the multiplicative group generated by <M>\xi</M>. 
Furthermore the centre of the algebra is <M>&QQ; (\chi)</M>, the field of character values over <M>&QQ; </M>,
and <M>N/K</M> is isomorphic to <M>Gal(&QQ; (\xi)/&QQ; (\chi))</M>.
<P/>

If the rational field is changed to an arbitrary ring <M>F</M> of characteristic <M>0</M> then the Wedderburn 
component <M>A_F(\chi)</M>, where <M>\chi = \chi(G,K,H)</M> is isomorphic to <M>F(\chi)\otimes_{&QQ; (\chi)}A_&QQ; (\chi)</M>.
Using the description given above of <M>A_&QQ; (\chi)=&QQ; G e(G,K,H)</M> one can easily describe <M>A_F(\chi)</M> as
<M>M_{nd}(F(\xi)/F(\chi),t')</M>, where <M>d=[&QQ; (\xi): &QQ;(\chi)]/[F(\xi):F(\chi)]</M> and

<Section Label="DivAlgTheory">
<Heading>Theory for Local Schur Index and Division Algebra Part Calculations</Heading>

(By Allen Herman, May 2013. Updated October 2014.) <P/>

The division algebra parts of simple algebras in the Wedderburn
Decomposition of the group algebra of a finite group over an abelian number
field <M>F</M> correspond to elements of the Schur Subgroup <M>S(F)</M> of
the Brauer group of <M>F</M>. Like all classes in the Brauer group of an
algebraic number field <M>F</M>, the division algebra part of a
representative of a given Brauer class is determined up to <M>F</M>-algebra
isomorphism by its list of local Hasse invariants at all primes (i.e.
places) of <M>F</M>. The local invariant at a prime <M>P</M> of <M>F</M> is
a lowest terms fraction <M>r/m_P</M> whose denominator is the local Schur
index <M>m_P</M> of the simple algebra at the prime <M>q</M> (see <Cite
Key="R" />). For division algebras whose Brauer class lies in the Schur
Subgroup of an abelian number field <M>F</M>, the local indices at any of
the primes <M>P</M> lying over the same rational prime <M>p</M> are equal
to the same positive integer <M>m_p</M>, and the numerator of the local
invariants among these primes are uniformly distributed among the integers
<M>r</M> coprime to <M>m_p</M> <Cite Key="BS"/>. <P/>

The local Schur index functions in wedderga produce a list of the nontrivial
local indices of the division algebra part of the simple algebra at all
rational primes. The Schur index of the simple algebra over <M>F</M> is the
least common multiple <M>m</M> of these local indices, and the dimension of
the division algebra part of the simple algebra over <M>F</M> is
<M>m^2</M>. While not sufficient to identify these division algebras up to
ring isomorphism in general, this list of local indices does identify the
division algebra up to ring isomorphism whenever there is no pair of local
indices at odd primes that are greater than 2. (This is at least the case
for groups of order less than 3^2*7*13.) So it gives the information
desired in most basic situations, and allows one to distinguish almost all
pairs of simple components of group algebras.  <P/>

Wedderga's functions compute local indices for generalized quaternion
algebras defined over the rationals and cyclotomic algebras defined over
any abelian number field.  Special shortcut functions are available for
cyclic cyclotomic algebras.  There are also versions of the functions that
compute the local and global Schur index of a character of a finite group
over a given abelian number field.  The steps in the general character-
theoretic method involve 1) a Brauer-Witt reduction to a cyclic-by-abelian
group, 2) use of the Frobenius-Schur indicator to compute the local index
at infinity, 3) computing the <M>p</M>-local index for an ordinary
irreducible character <M>\chi</M> of a <M>p</M>-solvable group using the
values of an irreducible Brauer character in the same <M>p</M>-block 
in cases where  the <M>p</M>-defect group of <M>\chi</M> is cyclic, and 
4) use of Riese and Schmid's characterization of dyadic Schur groups 
(<Cite Key="Sch"/> and <Cite Key="RSch"/>) to handle the exceptional cases
where step 3) is not available. 

Our approach to rational quaternion algebras is the standard one given, for
example, in <Cite Key="Pi"/>. The Legendre symbol operation in GAP is used
to determine the local index at odd primes. The local index of the
generalized quaternion algebra <M>(a,b)</M> over <M>Q</M> at the infinite
prime will be <M>2</M> if both <M>a</M> and <M>b</M> are negative, and
otherwise <M>1</M>. We avoid the complicated case of quadratic reciprocity
when working over Q by using the Hasse-Brauer-Albert-Noether Theorem (<Cite
Key="R"/>, pg. 276): since we know the other primes of <M>Q</M> where the
local index is <M>2</M>, it determines the local index at the prime
<M>2</M>. For generalized quaternion algebras over number fields <M>F</M>
other than <M>Q</M>, we have to convert to cyclic or cyclic cyclotomic
algebras and use the other local index functions, or appeal to a number 
theory system outside of GAP that can solve norm equations. <P/>

There are three shortcut functions used to compute local indices of cyclic
cyclotomic algebras, which wedderga's -Info functions produce in the form
<M>[r,F,n,[a,b,c]]</M>. The local index at infinity is calculated by 
determining if the real completion of the corresponding algebra will produce a real quaternion algebra. In order to do this, <M>F</M> must be a
real subfield, <M>n</M> must be strictly greater than <M>2</M>, and 
<M>E(n)^c</M> (which has to be a root of unity in <M>F</M>) must be 
<M>-1</M>.  These facts can be checked directly, so this is faster than
calculating the character table of the group and checking the value of a
Frobenius-Schur indicator.  

The shortcut to calculate the local index of a cyclic cyclotomic algebra at 
an odd prime makes direct use of the following lemma of Janusz: If 
<M>E_p/F_p</M> is a Galois extension of <M>p</M>-local fields with
ramification index <M>e</M>, and <M>z</M> is a root of unity with order
prime to <M>p</M>, then <M>z</M> is a norm in <M>E_p/F_p</M> if and only 
if it is the <M>e</M>-th power of a root of unity in <M>F</M>. 
(<Cite Key="J"/>, pg. 535). It follows that in order to calculate the local
index at <M>p</M> of a cyclic cyclotomic algebra <M>[r,F,n,[a,b,c]]</M>, we
first determine the splitting degree, residue degree, and ramification
index <M>e</M> of the extension <M>F(\zeta_n)/F</M> at <M>p</M>.  Comparing
the behaviour of the Galois automorphism <M>\sigma_b</M> to the behaviour
of the Frobenius automorphism at <M>p</M> allows us to determine the order
of the largest root of unity <M>z</M> with order coprime to <M>p</M> in the
<M>p</M>-completion <M>F_p</M>.  The local index <M>m_p</M> is then the
least power of <M>E(n)^c</M> that lies in the group generated by 
<M>z^e</M>. <P/> Calculation of the local index at the prime <M>2</M> makes
use of the following consequence of (<Cite Key="J"/>, Theorem 5): A cyclic
cyclotomic algebra <M>[r,F_2,n,[a,b,c]]</M> over a <M>2</M>-local field
<M>F_2</M> that is a subfield of a cyclotomic extension of the rational
<M>2</M>-local field <M>Q_2</M> has Schur index at most <M>2</M>. It has
Schur index <M>2</M> if and only if <M>4</M> divides <M>n</M>,
<M>F_2(\zeta_4)</M> is totally ramified of degree 2, the Galois automorphism <M>\sigma_b</M> of <M>F_2(\zeta_n)/F_2</M> inverts all 
<M>2</M>-power roots of unity in <M>F_2(\zeta_n)</M>, the order of 
<M>E(n)^c</M> is 2 times an odd number, and <M>(F_2:Q_2)</M> is odd. The
same approach to cyclotomic reciprocity makes it possible to check all of
these conditions in the <M>2</M>-local situation. <P/>

The wedderga function that computes the <M>p</M>-local index of an ordinary
irreducible character <M>\chi</M> of a finite non-nilpotent cyclic-by-
abelian group <M>G</M> is based directly on a theorem of Benard 
<Cite Key="B"/> that applies whenever the <M>p</M>-defect group of 
<M>\chi</M> is cyclic.  We have to restrict our application of it to groups
whose orders are small because the &GAP; records for irreducible Brauer characters are only available in these cases. In order to use this approach effectively, we developed a function that computes the defect group of the block containing a given ordinary irreducible character <M>\chi</M>.  This function makes use of the Min half of Brauer's Min-Max theorem (see Theorem 4.4 of <Cite Key="N"/>), and thus is able to find the defect group directly from the ordinary character table. It is thus available for nonsolvable groups, even in cases where &GAP;'s Brauer character records are not available.  We are indebted to Michael Geline and Friederich Ladisch for discussions concerning the calculation of defect groups in &GAP;. The current algorithm we use is based on an approach suggested by Ladisch.

Using the description of the primitive central idempotents and the Wedderburn components of a semisimple finite group algebra

When <M>G</M> is not nilpotent, we can still use the following description in some specific cases.

Let <M>G</M> be a finite group and <M>\mathbb F</M> a finite field of order <M>s</M> such that <M>s</M> is coprime to the 
order of <M>G</M>. Let <M>(H,K)</M> be a strong Shoda pair of <M>G</M> such that <M>\tau(gH,g'H)=1</M> for all 
<M>g,g'\in E=E_G(H/K)</M>, and let <M>C\in\mathcal{C}(H/K)</M>. Let <M>\varepsilon=\varepsilon_C(H,K)</M> and <M>e=e_C(G,H,K)</M> 
(<Ref Sect="CyclotomicClass" />). Let <M>w</M> be a normal element of <M>\mathbb F_{s^o}/\mathbb F_{s^{o/[E:H]}}</M> (with <M>o</M> 
the multiplicative order of <M>s</M> modulo <M>[H:K]</M>) and <M>B</M> the normal basis determined by <M>w</M>. 
Let <M>\psi</M> be the isomorphism between <M>\mathbb F E \varepsilon</M> and the matrix algebra 
<M>M_{[E:H]}(\mathbb F_{s^{o/[E:H]}})</M> with respect to the basis <M>B</M> as stated in Corollary 29.8 in <Cite Key="R" />.
Let <M>P,A\in M_{[E:H]}(\mathbb F_{s^{o/[E:H]}})</M> be the matrices 
<Display>
P= \left( \begin{array}{rrrrrr} 
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots\\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; -1 &amp; 0\\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; -1\\
\end{array} \right)
\quad {\rm and } \quad 
A= \left( \begin{array}{ccccc}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\

Then 
<Display>
\{x\widehat{T_1}\varepsilon x^{-1} \mid x\in T_2\langle{x_e}\rangle\}
</Display>
is a complete set of orthogonal primitive idempotents of <M>\mathbb F G e</M> where <M>x_e=\psi^{-1}(PAP^{-1})</M>, 
<M>T_1</M> is a transversal of <M>H</M> in <M>E</M> and <M>T_2</M> is a right transversal of <M>E</M> in <M>G</M> 
(<Cite Key="OV2" />). By <M>\widehat{T_1}</M> we denote the element <M>\frac{1}{|T_1|}\sum_{t\in T_1}{t}</M> in <M>\mathbb F G</M>.

<Index>linear code</Index>
A <E>linear code</E> of length <M>n</M> and rank <M>k</M> is a linear subspace <M>C</M> with dimension <M>k</M> 
of the vector space <M>\mathbb F_q^n</M>. The standard basis of <M>\mathbb F_q^n</M> is denoted by <M>E=\{e_1,...,e_n\}</M>. 
The vectors in <M>C</M> are called codewords, the size of a code is the number of codewords and equals <M>q^k</M>. 
The distance of a code is the minimum distance between distinct codewords, i.e. the number of elements in which they differ. <P/>

<Index>group code</Index>
For any group <M>G</M>, we denote by <M>\mathbb F_q G</M> the group algebra over <M>G</M> with coefficients in <M>\mathbb F_q</M>. 
If <M>G</M> is a group of order <M>n</M> and <M>C\subseteq \mathbb F_q^n</M> is a linear code, then we say that <M>C</M> 
is a left <M>G</M>-code (respectively a <M>G</M>-code) if there is a bijection <M>\phi:E\rightarrow G</M> such that the linear 
extension of <M>\phi</M> to an isomorphism <M>\phi:\mathbb F_q^n\rightarrow \mathbb F_q G</M> maps <M>C</M> to a left ideal 
(respectively a two-sided ideal) of <M>\mathbb F_q G</M>. A left <E>group code</E> (respectively a group code) is a linear code which 
is a left <M>G</M>-code (respectively a <M>G</M>-code) for some group <M>G</M>. <P/>

Since left ideals in <M>\mathbb F_q G</M> are generated by idempotents, there is a one-one relation between (sums of) 
primitive idempotents of <M>\mathbb F_q G</M> and left <M>G</M>-codes over <M>\mathbb F_q</M>.<P/>

Note that each element <M>c</M> in <M>\mathbb F_q G</M> is of the form <M>c=\sum_{i=1}^n f_i g_i</M>, 
where we fix an ordering <M>\{g_1,g_2,...,g_n \}</M> of the group elements of <M>G</M> and <M>f_i\in \mathbb F_q</M>. 
If one looks at <M>c</M> as a codeword, one writes <M>[f_1 f_2 ... f_n]</M>. <P/>
