<Index>group ring</Index>
Given a group <M>G</M> and an ring <M>R</M>, the <E>group ring</E> 
<M>RG</M> over the group <M>G</M> with coefficients in <M>R</M> is the ring whose underlying additive 
group is a right <M>R-</M>module with basis <M>G</M> such that the product is defined by the 
following rule
  <Display> 
  (gr)(hs)=(gh)(rs)
  </Display>
for <M>r,s \in R</M> and <M>g, h \in G</M>, and extended to <M>RG</M> by linearity.
<P/>

<Index>group algebra</Index>
A <E>group algebra</E> is a group ring in which the coefficient ring is a field.

<Index>semisimple artinian ring</Index>
A ring <M>R</M> is <E>semisimple artinian</E> if it is a direct sum of simple left 
(alternatively right) ideals or equivalently if <M>R</M> is isomorphic to a
direct product of simple algebras each one isomorphic
to a matrix ring over a division ring. <P/>

By Maschke's Theorem the group algebra <M>FG</M> is semisimple artinian if and only
if the group <M>G</M> is finite and the characteristic of the coefficient field 
<M>F</M> does not divide the order of <M>G</M>.

<Index>Wedderburn decomposition</Index>
<Index>Wedderburn components</Index>
If <M>R</M> is a <E>semisimple ring</E> (<Ref Sect="Semisimple" />) then the <E>Wedderburn decomposition</E> of 
<M>R</M> is the decomposition of <M>R</M> as a direct product of simple algebras. 
The factors of this Wedderburn decomposition are called <E>Wedderburn components</E>
of <M>R</M>. 
Each Wedderburn component of <M>R</M> is of the form <M>Re</M> for <M>e</M> a <E>primitive central 
idempotent</E> (<Ref Sect="Idempotents" />) of <M>R</M><P/> 


Let <M>FG</M> be a <E>semisimple group algebra</E> (<Ref Sect="Semisimple" />).
If <M>F</M> has positive characteristic then the Wedderburn components of <M>FG</M>
are matrix algebras over finite extensions of <M>F</M>.
If <M>F</M> has zero characteristic then by the <E>Brauer-Witt Theorem</E> <Cite Key="Y" />, 
the <E>Wedderburn components</E> of <M>FG</M> are <E>Brauer equivalent</E> 
(<Ref Sect="Brauer" />)
to <E>cyclotomic algebras</E> (<Ref Sect="Cyclotomic" />). <P/> 

The main functions of &Wedderga; compute the Wedderburn components of a semisimple group algebra <M>FG</M>,
such that the coefficient field is either an abelian number field (i.e. a subfield of a finite cyclotomic extension 
of the rationals) or a finite field. 
In the finite case the Wedderburn components are matrix algebras over finite fields and so can be described by the 
size of the matrices and the size of the finite field.<P/>
In the zero characteristic case each Wedderburn components <M>A</M> is <E>Brauer equivalent</E> (<Ref Sect="Brauer"/>)
to a <E>cyclotomic algebra</E> (<Ref Sect="Cyclotomic" />) 
and therefore <M>A</M> is a 
(possibly fractional) matrix algebras over <E>cyclotomic algebras</E> 
and can be described numerically in one of the following three forms
forms:
  <Display>
  [n,K]
  </Display> 

  <Display>
  [n,K,k,[o,\alpha,\beta]]
  </Display>
  
  <Display>
  [n,K,[o_i,\alpha_i,\beta_i]_{i=1}^n, [\gamma_{j,k}]_{(j,k)\in I_n} ]
  </Display>
where <M>n</M> is the matrix size, <M>K</M> is the centre of <M>A</M> (a finite field extension of <M>F</M>) 
and the remaining data are integers whose interpretation is explained in <Ref Sect="NumDesc" />.
<P/>

In some cases (for the zero characteristic coefficient field) the size <M>n</M> of the matrix algebras is not a 
positive integer but a positive rational number. 
This is is a consequence of the fact that the <E>Brauer-Witt Theorem</E> <Cite Key="Y" /> only ensures that
each <E>Wedderburn component</E> (<Ref Sect="WedDec" />) of a semisimple group algebra is Brauer equivalent 
(<Ref Sect="Brauer" />) to <E>cyclotomic algebras</E> (<Ref Sect="Cyclotomic" />), but not necessarily isomorphic to full matrix algebras of cyclotomic algebras. 
For example a Wedderburn component <M>D</M> of a group algebra can be a division algebra but not a cyclotomic algebra. 
In this case <M>M_n(D)</M> is cyclotomic algebra <M>C</M> for some <M>n</M> and therefore <M>D</M> can be describred
as <M>M_{1/n}(C)</M> (see last Example in <Ref Attr="WedderburnDecomposition" />).<P/> 

The main algorithm of &Wedderga; is based in a computational oriented proof of the Brauer-Witt Theorem
due to Olteanu <Cite Key="O" /> which uses previous work by Olivieri, del Río and Simón <Cite Key="ORS" /> and 
for rational group algebras of <E>strongly monomial groups</E> 
(<Ref Sect="StMon" />).

<Index>primitive central idempotent</Index>
A <E>primitive central idempotent</E> of a ring <M>R</M> is a non-zero central idempotent

The <E>Wedderburn components</E> (<Ref Sect="WedDec" />) of a semisimple ring 
<M>R</M> are the rings of the form <M>Re</M> for <M>e</M> running on the set 
of primitive central idempotents of <M>R</M>. <P/>

Let <M>FG</M> be <E>semisimple group algebra</E> (<Ref Sect="Semisimple" />)

The map <M>\chi \mapsto A_F(\chi)</M> defines a surjective map from the set of irreducible characters of 
<M>G</M> (in an algebraic closure of <M>F</M>) onto the set of Wedderburn components of <M>FG</M>.

Equivalently, the map <M>\chi \mapsto e_F(\chi)</M> defines a surjective map from the set of irreducible characters

<B>Intrinsecal definition</B>.

A <E>crossed product</E> <Cite Key="P" /> of <M>G</M> over <M>R</M> (or with coefficients in <M>R</M>) is a ring <M>RG</M> with 
a decomposition into a direct sum of additive subgroups

* <M>A_g A_h = A_{gh}</M> and <P/>
* <M>A_g</M> has a unit of <M>RG</M>.<P/>

<B>Extrinsecal definition</B>.

Let <M>Aut(R)</M> denote the group of automorphisms of <M>R</M> and let <M>R^*</M> denote the group of units of 
<M>R</M>.<P/>

Let <M>a:G \rightarrow Aut(R)</M> and <M>t:G \times G \rightarrow R</M> maps satisfying the following conditions 
for every <M>g</M>, <M>h</M> and <M>k</M> in <M>G</M>: <P/>

(1) <M>a(gh)^{-1} a(g) a(h)</M> is the inner automorphism of <M>R</M> induced by 
<M>t(g,h)</M> (i.e. the automorphism <M>x\mapsto t(g,h)^{-1} x t(g,h)</M>) and <P/>

(2) <M>t(gh,k) t(g,h)^k = t(g,hk) t(h,k).</M> <P/>

The <E>crossed product</E> <Cite Key="P" /> of <M>G</M> over <M>R</M> (or with coefficients in <M>R</M>), 
action <M>a</M> and twisting <M>t</M> is the ring

where <M>\{u_g : g\in G}</M> is a set of symbols in one-to-one correspondence with <M>G</M>, and the

   (u_g r) + (u_g s) = u_g(r+s) \quad (u_g r)(u_h s) = u_{gh} t(g,h) r^h s

for <M>g,h \in G</M> and <M>r,s\in R</M>, and extended to <M>R*_a^t G</M> by linearity, where <P/>

The associativity of the product defined is a consequence of conditions (1) and (2) <Cite Key="P" />.<P/>

<B>Equivalence of the two definitions</B>.

Obviously the crossed product of <M>G</M> over <M>R</M> defined using the extrinsecal definition is a crossed product 
of <M>G</M> over <M>u_1 R</M> in the sense of the first definition. 
Moreover there is <M>r_0</M> in <M>R^*</M> such that <M>u_1r_0</M> is the identity of <M>R_a^t G</M> and the map 
<M>r \mapsto u_1 r_0 r </M> is a ring isomorphism <M>R \rightarrow u_1R </M>. <P/>

<Index Key="Basis of units">Basis of units (for crossed product)</Index>
Conversely, let <M>R*G=\oplus_{g\in G} A_g</M> be an (intrinsecal) crossed product and select for each <M>g\in G</M> a 
unit <M>u_g\in A_g</M> of <M>R*G</M>. 
This is called a <E>basis of units for the crossed product</E> <M>R*G</M>. 
Then the maps <M>a:G \rightarrow Aut(R)</M> and <M>G\times G \rightarrow R^*</M> given by 
  <Display>
  a(g)(r) = u_g^{-1} r u_g \quad t(g,h) = u_{gh}\inv u_g u_h \quad (g,h \in G, r \in R)
  </Display>
satisfy conditions (1) and (2) and <M>R*G = R_a^t G</M>. <P/>

The election of a basis of units <M>u_g \in A_g</M> determines the action <M>a</M> and twisting <M>t</M>. 
If <M>\{u_g \in A_g : g \in G \}</M> and <M>\{v_g \in A_g : g \in G \}</M> are two sets of units of <M>R*G</M>
then <M>v_g = u_g r_g</M> for some units <M>r_g</M> of <M>R</M>. 
Changing the basis of units results in a change of action an twisting and so change the extrinsecal definition of
the crossed product but it does not change the intrinsecal crossed product. <P/> 

It is costumary to select <M>u_1=1</M>. In that case <M>a(1)</M> is the identity map of <M>R</M> and 
<M>t(1,g)=t(g,1)=1</M> for each <M>g</M> in <M>G</M>.

Let <M>G</M> be a finite group.

A <E>Shoda pair</E> of <M>G</M> is a pair <M>(K,H)</M> of subgroups of <M>G</M>

then the <E>primitive central idempotent</E>  (<Ref Sect="Idempotents" />)
of <M>QG</M> 
associated to the irreducible character <M>\chi^G</M> is of the form

A group <M>G</M> is monomial, that is every irreducible character of <M>G</M> is

<Heading>Strong Shoda pairs</Heading>

<Index>strong Shoda pair</Index>
A <E>strong Shoda pair</E> of <M>G</M> is a pair <M>(K,H)</M> of
subgroups of <M>G</M> satisfying the following conditions:<P/>
* <M>H</M> is normal in <M>K</M> and <M>K</M> is normal in the normalizer <M>N</M> of <M>H</M> in 
  <M>G</M>, <P/>
* <M>K/H</M> is cyclic and a maximal abelian subgroup of <M>N/H</M> and <P/>
* for every <M>g \in G\setminus N</M> ,  <M>\varepsilon(K,H)\varepsilon(K,H)^g=0</M>.
(See <Ref Sect="IdempotentsSbgps" /> for the definition of <M>\varepsilon(K,H)</M>).
<P/>

Let <M>(K,H)</M> be a strong Shoda pair of <M>G</M>. 
Then <M>(K,H)</M> is a Shoda pair (<Ref Sect="IdempotentsSbgps" />) of <M>G</M>. 
Thus there is a linear character <M>\theta(K,H)</M> of <M>K</M> with kernel <M>H</M> such that 
<M>\chi=\chi(G,K,H)=\theta(K,H)^G</M> is irreducible. 
Moreover the <E>primitive central idempotent</E> (<Ref Sect="Idempotents" />)
<M>e_{Q}(\chi)</M> of <M>QG</M> 
realized by <M>(K,H)</M> is <M>e(G,K,H)</M>, see <Cite Key="ORS" />. <P/>

<Index>equivalent strong Shoda pairs</Index>
Two <E>strong Shoda pairs</E> (<Ref Sect="SSPDef"/>) <M>(K_1,H_1)</M> and <M>(K_2,H_2)</M> of <M>G</M> 
are said to be <E>equivalent</E> if the characters
<M>\chi(G,K_1,H_2)</M> and <M>\chi(G,K_2,H_2)</M> are Galois conjugate, or equivalently if 
<M>e(G,K_1,H_1=e_(G,K_2,H_2)</M>.<P/>

The advantage of strong Shoda pairs with respect to Shoda pairs is that one can describe the simple algebra
<M>FGe_F(\chi)</M> as a matrix algebra of a <E>cyclotomic algebra</E> 
(<Ref Sect="Cyclotomic" />, see <Cite Key="ORS" /> for <M>F=Q</M> and 
<Cite Key="O" /> for the general case). <P/>

More precisely <M>QGe(G,K,H)</M> is isomorphic to <M>M_n(Q(\xi)*_a^t N/K)</M>, 
where <M>\xi</M> is a <M>[K:H]</M>-th root of unity, <M>N</M> is the normalizer of 
<M>H</M> in <M>G</M>, <M>n=[G:N]</M> and <M>Q(\xi)*_a^t N/K</M> is a <E>crossed product</E> (see <Ref Sect="CrossedProd" />) with action <M>a</M> and twisting <M>t</M> given as follows: <P/>
Let <M>x</M> be a fixed generator of <M>K/H</M> and 
<M>\varphi : N/K \rightarrow N/H</M> a fixed left inverse of the canonical projection 
<M>N/H\rightarrow N/K</M>. Then 
  <Display>
  \xi^{a(n)} = \xi^i, \mbox{ if }  x^{\varphi(a)}= x^i
  </Display>
and 
  <Display>
  t(a,b) = \xi^j, \mbox{ if } \varphi(ab)^{-1} \varphi(a)\varphi(b) = x^j,
  </Display>
for <M>a,b \in N/K</M> and integers <M>i</M> and <M>j</M>, see <Cite Key="ORS" />. 
Notice that the cocycle is the one given by the natural extension
  <Display>
  1 \rightarrow K/H \rightarrow N/H \rightarrow N/K \rightarrow 1 
  </Display>
where <M>K/H</M> is identify with the multiplicative group generated by <M>\xi</M>. 
Furthermore the centre of the algebra is <M>Q(\chi)</M>, the field of character values over <M>Q</M>,
and <M>N/K</M> is isomorphic to the <M>Gal(Q(\xi)/Q(\chi))</M>.
<P/>

If the rational field is changed by an arbitrary ring <M>F</M> of characteristic <M>0</M> then the Wedderburn 
component <M>A_F(\chi)</M>, where <M>\chi = \chi(G,K,H)</M> is isomorphic to <M>F(\chi)\otimes_{Q(\chi)}A_Q(\chi)</M>.
Using the description given above of <M>A_Q(\chi)=QG e(G,K,H)</M> one can easily describe <M>A_F(\chi)</M> as
<M>M_{nd}(F(\xi)/F(\chi),t')</M>, where <M>d=[\Q(\xi):\Q(\chi)]/[F(\xi):F(\chi)]</M> and 
<M>t'</M> is the restriction to <M>Gal(F(\xi)/F(\chi))</M> of <M>t</M> 
(a cocycle of <M>N/K = Gal(Q(\xi)/Q(\chi))</M>) <P/>

The group <M>G</M> is <E>strongly monomial</E> if every irreducible character of <M>G</M> is 
strongly monomial. <P/>

Strong Shoda pairs where firstly introduced by Olivieri, del Río and Simón <Cite Key="ORS" /> who proved that 
every abelian-by-supersolvable is strongly monomial  <Cite Key="ORS" />.
The algorithm to compute the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras for strongly monomial groups
was explained in <Cite Key="OR" />. 
This method was extended for semisimple finite group algebras by Broche Cristo and del Río in <Cite Key="BR" /> 
(see Section <Ref Sect="CyclotomicClass" />). 
Finally Olteanu <Cite Key="O" /> shows how to compute the <E>Wedderburn decomposition</E> (<Ref Sect="WedDec" />)
of an arbitrary semisimple group ring by making use of not only the strong Shoda pairs of <M>G</M> but also 
the strong Shoda pairs of the subgroups of <M>G</M>.

<Heading>Cyclotomic Classes and Strong Shoda Pairs</Heading>

Let <M>G</M> be a finite group and <M>F</M> a finite field of order <M>q</M>, 
coprime with the order of <M>G</M>. <P/>

<Index>cyclotomic class</Index>
Given a positive integer <M>n</M>, coprime with <M>q</M>, the <M>q</M>-<E>cyclotomic classes</E> 
modulo <M>n</M> are the set of residues classes module <M>n</M> of the form
  <Display>
  \{i,iq,iq^2,iq^3, \dots \}
  </Display>
The <M>q</M>-cyclotomic classes module <M>n</M> form a partition of the set of residue classes module <M>n</M>. <P/>

<Index>generating cyclotomic class</Index>
A <E>generating cyclotomic class </E> module <M>n</M> is a cyclotomic class containing 
a generator of the additive group of residue classes module <M>n</M>, or equivalently 
formed by integers coprime with <M>n</M>. <P/>

Let <M>(K,H)</M> be a strong Shoda pair (<Ref Sect="SSPDef" />) 
of <M>G</M> and set <M>n=[K:H]</M>. 
Fix a primitive <M>n</M>-th root of the unity <M>\xi</M> in some extension of <M>F</M>
and an element <M>g</M> of <M>K</M> such that <M>gH</M> is a generator of <M>K/H</M>.
Given <M>C</M>, a generating <M>q</M>-cyclotomic class module <M>n</M> one defines 
    <Display>
    \varepsilon_C(K,H) =
    [K:H]\inv \overline{H} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}} tr(\xi^{-ci})g^i,
    </Display>
where <M>c</M> is an arbitrary element of <M>C</M> and <M>tr</M> is the trace map 
of the field extension <M>F(\xi)/F</M>. Then <M>\varepsilon_C(K,H)</M> does not 
depend on the election of <M>c \in C</M> and it is a <E>primitive central idempotent</E>  
(<Ref Sect="Idempotents" />) of <M>FK</M>. <P/>

<Index>primitive central idempotent realized by a strong Shoda pair and a cyclotomic class</Index>
Finally let <M>e_C(G,K,H)</M> denote the sum of the different <M>G</M>-conjugates of
<M>\varepsilon_C(K,H)</M>. 
Then <M>e_C(G,K,H)</M> is a <E>primitive central idempotent</E>  
(<Ref Sect="Idempotents" />) of <M>FG</M> <Cite Key="BR" />. 
Then we say that <M>e_C(G,K,H)</M> is the primitive central idempotent realized by the 
strong Shoda pair <M>(K,H)</M> of the group <M>G</M> and the cyclotomic class <M>C</M>.
<P/>

If <M>G</M> is <E>strongly monomial</E> (<Ref Sect="StMon" />) then every primitive central idempotent of <M>FG</M> 
is realizable by some <E>strong Shoda pair</E> (<Ref Sect="SSPDef"/>) of <M>G</M> and some cyclotomic class <M>C</M> 
<Cite Key="BR" />. As in the zero characteristic case, this explain how to compute the <E>Wedderburn decomposition</E> 
(<Ref Sect="WedDec" />) of <M>FG</M> for a finite semisimple algebra of a strongly monomial group 
(see <Cite Key="BR" /> for details). 

For non strongly monomial groups the algorithm to compute the Wedderburn decomposition just uses the Brauer 
characters.
