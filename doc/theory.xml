<Heading>Wedderburn decomposition</Heading>

A ring <M>R</M> is semisimple artinian if it is a direct sum of simple left 
(alternatively right) ideals or equivalently if <M>R</M> is isomorphic to a
direct product of simple algebras each one isomorphic
to a matrix ring over a division ring. <P/>

<Index>Wedderburn decomposition</Index>
<Index>Wedderburn components</Index>
If <M>R</M> is a semisimple ring then the <E>Wedderburn decomposition</E> of 
<M>R</M> is the decomposition of <M>R</M> as a direct product of simple algebras. 
The factors of this Wedderburn decomposition are called <E>Wedderburn components</E>
of <M>R</M>. 
Each Wedderburn component of <M>R</M> is of the form <M>Re</M> for <M>e</M> a primitive central idempotent 
<Ref Sect="Idempotents" /> of <M>R</M><P/> 

By Maschke's Theorem the group algebra <M>FG</M> is semisimple artinian if and only
if the group <M>G</M> is finite and the characteristic of the coefficient field 
<M>F</M> does not divide the order of <M>G</M>. <P/>

Let <M>FG</M> be a semisimple group algebra.
If <M>F</M> has positive characteristic then the Wedderburn components of <M>FG</M>
are matrix algebras over finite extensions of <M>F</M>.
If <M>F</M> has zero characteristic then by the <E>Brauer-Witt Theorem</E> <Cite Key="Y" />, 
the <E>Wedderburn components</E> of <M>FG</M> are <E>Brauer equivalent</E> <Ref Sect="Brauer" /> 
to cyclotomic algebras <Ref Sect="Cyclotomic" />. <P/> 

The main functions of &Wedderga; compute the Wedderburn components of a semisimple group algebra <M>FG</M>,
such that the coefficient field is either an abelian number field (i.e. a subfield of a finite cyclotomic extension 
of the rationals) or a finite field. 
In the finite case the Wedderburn components are matrix algebras over finite fields and so can be described by the 
size of the matrices and the size of the finite field.<P/>
In the zero characteristic case the Wedderburn components are given as matrix algebras over cyclotomic algebras 
<Ref Sect="Cyclotomic" />, and can be described numerical as 
  <Display>
  [n,k,[o_i,\alpha_i,\beta_i]_{i=1}^n, [\gamma_{j,k}]_{(j,k)\in I_n} ]
  </Display>
where <M>n</M> is the matrix size and the meaning of the remaining data is as explained in  <Ref Sect="NumDesc" />.
<P/>

In some cases (for the zero characteristic coefficient field) the size of the matrix algebras is not a positive 
integer but a rational number. 
This is is a consequence of the fact that the <E>Brauer-Witt Theorem</E> <Cite Key="Y" /> only ensures that
the Wedderburn components of <M>FG</M> are Brauer equivalent <Ref Sect="Brauer" /> to cyclotomic algebras 
<Ref Sect="Cyclotomic" />, but not necessarily isomorphic to full matrix algebras of cyclotomic algebras. 
For example a Wedderburn component <M>D</M> of a group algebra can be division algebra but not a cyclotomic algebra. 
In that case <M>M_n(D)</M> is cyclotomic algebra <M>C</M> for some <M>n</M> and therefore <M>D</M> can be describred
as <M>M_{1/n}(C)</M>.<P/> 

The main algorithm of &Wedderga; is based in a computational oriented proof of the Brauer-Witt Theorem
due to Olteanu <Cite Key="Olteanu" /> which uses previous work by Olivieri, del Río and Simón <Cite Key="ORS" />
for rational group algebras of strongly monomial groups <Ref Sect="SSPDef" />.

where <M>c</M> is an arbitrary element of <M>C</M> and <M>tr</M> is the trace map 
of the field extension <M>F(\xi)/F</M>. Then <M>\varepsilon_C(K,H)</M> does not 
depend on the election of <M>c \in C</M> and it is a primitive central idempotent of
<M>FK</M>. <P/>

<Index>primitive central idempotent realized by a strongly Shoda pair and a cyclotomic class</Index>
Finally let <M>e_C(G,K,H)</M> denote the sum of the different <M>G</M>-conjugates of
<M>\varepsilon_C(K,H)</M>. 
Then <M>e_C(G,K,H)</M> is a primitive central idempotent of <M>FG</M> <Cite Key="BR" />. 
Then we say that <M>e_C(G,K,H)</M> is the primitive central idempotent realized by the 
strongly Shoda pair <M>(K,H)</M> of the group <M>G</M> and the cyclotomic class <M>C</M>.
<P/>

If <M>G</M> is strongly monomial then every primitive central idempotent of <M>FG</M> is realizable 
by some strongly Shoda pair of <M>G</M> and some cyclotomic class <M>C</M> 
<Cite Key="BR" />. As in the zero characteristic case, this explain how to compute the Wedderburn decomposition
of <M>FG</M> for a finite semisimple algebra of a strongly monomial group (see <Cite Key="BR" /> for details). 

For non strongly monomial groups the algorithm to compute the Wedderburn decomposition just uses the Brauer 
characters.
