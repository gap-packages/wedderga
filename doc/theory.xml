In this chapter we describe the theory that is behind the algorithms used by
&Wedderga;.

<Index>group algebra</Index>
Let <M>G</M> be a group and <M>F</M> a field. Then the <E>group algebra</E> 
<M>FG</M> consists of the set of formal linear combinations of the form 
<Display> 
\sum_{g \in G}\alpha_g g,\qquad \alpha_g \in F
</Display>
where all but finitely many of the <M>\alpha_g</M> are zero. The group algebra
<M>FG</M> is an <M>F</M>-algebra with the obvious operations. 
Clearly, <M>\dim FG=|G|</M>.<P/>

<Index Key="Modular group algebra">Modular group algebra</Index>
A group algebra <M>FG</M> is said to be <E>modular</E> if <M>F</M> is the
field of characteristic <M>p</M>, and <M>G</M> contains an element of order
<M>p</M>.
